# libft
libc project

This project recreates C standard library functions to create a library that we base all of our work at WeThinkCode on. 
The only functions we had access to were `write`, `malloc` and `free`. 
Any and all other functions we required had to be created from scratch.

Concepts tested:
- C-Style string handling
- Memory allocation
- Pointers
- Algorithms
- I/O and Printing
